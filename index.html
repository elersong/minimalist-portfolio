          I am a developer with 5+ years experience in the SaaS field,
          stretching end-to-end from product design and development to
          operations and support. I have contributed to projects for both
          small-business and multi-national enterprises. I find elegance in
          simplicity, and I bring that benefit to my clients and teams while
          meeting modern standards, best practices and key performance goals.

            I served as an operational member of the 9-person team that organized
            and hosted a technology conference around the idea of mentorship that
            went on to break the record for the world's largest tech conference by
            number of registrations. I wrote spiders in ruby to collect and process

            As an exercise in language processing and creative writing, I started
            "The Bibble," an attempt to bridge the gap between religious text and
            secular morals. What would the Bible look like if it weren't written
            for a religious audience? I designed an interface that would organize
            a secular interpretation beside original biblical text, and I plan to
            build the application using Aurelia, React and Firebase.

            I built The Plotline using ruby Sinatra, the Twilio phone system API

            broadcast system for delivery of short stories written by small-renown 
            authors. For a small fee, users could hear a recording of a short story
            performance, complete with sound effects. The proceeds would cover 
            production costs and support small writers.

        <h2>Who Am I?</h2>
        <p>
            I'm the best hiring decision you'll make this year. I not only pay close
            attention to the needs of my teammates, but I seek to seamlessly integrate
            into my work environments, boosting efficiency and productivity through
            simple solutions that leverage existing resources. This drive to seek 
            continued growth both personally and for my peers tends to leave me 
            unsatisfied, but it also results in strong connections with those around
            me and thorough explorations of project goals.
        </p>
        <p>
            I've worked for years in the education sector, focusing heavily on technology
            and engineering. I have a strong network of mentors/advisors and a large 
            collection of my own students, who have gone one to accomplish great things.
            I enjoy working with teams and discovering new degrees of flexibility I was 
            not previously aware I possessed. 
        </p>
        <p>
            From business strategy and product design to client account management and 
            customer support, I have also built years of management experience working 
            on teams to craft processes that consistently meet key project performance
            goals. Not only am I comfortable speaking before groups, I actively enjoy
            the opportunity to cultivate "eureka!" moments among my peers.
        </p>
        <p>
            My professional goals between now and 2025 focus on identifying teams
            that push themselves to consistently and objectively improve, altering
            business practice to meet new needs as they arise rather than altering 
            perception of needs to meet comfortable and pre-determined business 
            practices. I like to focus only upon what's necessary and remove the
            extraneous.

        <h2>The Value of Changing the Medium</h2>
        <p class="date">23 Feb 2021</p>
        <p>
          As much as I hate to admit it, my dad was right. Back in grade school, he
          would drone on and on about the value of drilling concepts until they 
          became second-nature, turning them over in my mind until I extend past
          a simple knowledge and into true understanding. At the time, I knew everything
          about everything. Thankfully, I've grown some humility since then.
        </p>
        <p>
          I probably would have been a much better student as a teenager had I heeded
          his advice. When he would take time to interview me about my school lessons,
          he would inevitably ask me how I had studied. Once I had given him my faithfully
          mediocre response, he would ask me for my notes and begin to quiz me. He'd ask
          questions beyond the text, the kind that required me to be familiar not only 
          with the words on the page, but the relationships between their underlying 
          ideas. 
        </p>
        <p>
          While I found it irritating at the time, often whining about how my teachers
          didn't require me to know the material in that way, I can retrospectively
          see that he was preparing me for the world I would enter. As an adult, I 
          often find myself probing deeper into ideas to build a palpable mastery. When
          I do, I can very often hear my dad's voice affirming, "See? Those are the 
          things you can do when you're comfortable with the idea, because you changed
          up the medium." 
        </p>
        <p>
          As a kid, "changing the medium" meant rewriting my notes over and over, using
          flashcards or reading into a voice recorder to listen to the main points of the
          lesson while I did other things. This forced my mind to acclimate to differing
          ways of interacting with the same data, and as a result, I learned to build 
          mastery much more quickly than my peers, who paid attention to only the required
          manner of learning.
        </p>
        <p>
          Now, as an adult (legally speaking, anyway) in a world as complicated as it
          is unforgiving, I've grown to greatly appreciate the time my dad spent teaching
          me that lesson. My universe is a little easier to traverse than it otherwise
          could have been. Thanks, dad.

        <h2>Why Coding is Like Cooking</h2>
        <p class="date">25 Feb 2021</p>
        <p>
          Anybody who has weilded a semicolon has heard it before... "Oh I don't
          understand how you could enjoy that. Programming is so complicated. I 
          could never." And plenty of us have had the thought in response, "Well,
          if you should ever change your mind, don't call me." But despite the 
          perceived difficulty of taming the wild magic internet box, those who 
          often interface with it are in-tune with the simplicity of its pieces.
          Each one serves a specific purpose, which can be reduced to a generally
          simple task, much like another, more commonly-mastered, skill.
        </p>
        <p>
          There's a certain nefarious gratification I gain from impressing friends
          and family using skills taught in CS-101, but if I'm peculiarly honest
          about it, I'm certain that the same skills that make a great cook also
          result in a great programmer. If that were to become common knowledge,
          I'd end up with fewer cookies and slices of cake, which is simply unacceptable.
        </p>
        <p>
          Regardless, I firmly believe that while the knowledge of knife skills 
          and familiarity with complementary flavor proviles may not get you a 
          promotion in the tech field, both activities build upon common foundations.
          Hear me out. Both disciplines require 10k hours of improvement and build
          complexity from the elegant balance of small, simple steps. If I were to
          describe a paste made of salt, water and flour, wrapped around butter
          and smooshed flat, you may not immediately think of a croissant or puff
          pastry, but that's all it is. Likewise, if I mentioned a network of brief, 
          self-organizing messages, zipping around the world, managing billions
          of concurrent connections and influencing everything from politics to 
          world trade, you may not think of Twitter, yet here we are.
        </p>
        <p>
          In both cases, the end result can easily be thought of as far greater
          than the sum of numerous small, simple parts. But although the final 
          products may appear to exist out of the realm of possibility for the
          average bear, none of the individual steps to close the gap between the
          starting point and the destination are particularly difficult to understand.
          The most basic skill underpinning both disciplines is simply the ability
          to divide a large issue into a series of smaller and smaller issues, 
          becoming easier and easier to resolve with each iteration.
        </p>
        <p>
          So, I wasn't kidding. If it makes sense to you to start with a general
          plan, refining it to get a little closer to your target with each step
          you take, I would say that you're already largely qualified to attempt
          computer programming. But then again, what do I know?

        <h2>Frustration is the Mother of Creativity</h2>
        <p class="date">29 Feb 2021</p>
        <p>
          On days when I've spent hours staring blankly at an angry console, praying
          to whomever will listen that 305th attempt would somehow be different
          than the 304th, I tend to have my best ideas. You may not be willing to
          stake your retirement account in angel investment on that version of me, 
          and I wouldn't either if I hadn't lived through it so many times. The fact,
          however, still stands that the bottom of the barrel is where the best 
          ideas are born.
        </p>
        <p>
          It's really not the months of Array-function drills or masterclasses I've
          given my dogs on the principles of asynchronous techniques that have 
          brought me the most value as a developer. Like most people (or so I would
          assume), I can't easily notice everything, and bugs seem to naturally
          camouflage themselves within the shadows of my mind's eye. It's only 
          once I've checked all the usual hiding spots that I can begin to see 
          my projects as they truly are built, as opposed to the assumptions I 
          can usually get away with making about them. 
        </p>
        <p>
          Those moments, in my opinion, are when I truly grow as an engineer. That's 
          when I can find out how sharp my skills really are. I'm all out of tricks
          and cheap workarounds, and I have to form a concept that's entirely new
          to me. Unfortunately for all my patience, abstracting a new idea out of
          the ether is a painfully slow process, fraught with head-banging, tears
          and gnashing of teeth. The pride that emerges from a defeated challenge,
          however, makes every eternal moment entirely worth it... almost...
